1) Create/Move into the branch you will be working on (IMPORTANT).
    - if you are making changes while in main you could potentially mess up the project, so always 
    make sure you are in a separate branch.
    - command to see all branches available: git branch -a
    - command if you need to create a new branch: git branch branch_name
    - command to move into a branch: git checkout branch_name

2) Update your branch with the contents of the main branch to make sure everything you do is compatible.
    - This is called merging 2 branches together.
    - You are merging the main branch into your branch, not the other way around so main remains
    unchanged while your branch gets all the contents on main.
    command to merge: git merge main

3) Work on the features that your branch is implementing.
    - Store your changes often in case you mess something up by adding and commiting the changes:
    1)command to track all file changes: git add .
    2)command to commit all the changes: git commit -m "whatever your changes are"
    
4) When you are ready to upload the features to your branch so everyone can see them on github, you
will push them "upstream" to your branch:
    - This does not affect the main branch, this only uploads your branch so everyone can see it if
    they checkout your branch.
    command to push upstream into the repository: git push -u origin branch_name

5) Once you are finished implementing whatever you were working on, you can create a pull request so that your branch's 
content can be merged into the main branch. (Do not merge the contents yourself, always do a pull request)

6) When your pull request has been accepted and your branch has been successfully merged into main, you can delete your branch.
    - make sure you are absolutely positive you don't need anything from that branch before deleting.
    - command to delete branch: git push origin --delete branch_name
